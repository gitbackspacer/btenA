Host:    j64n3 (AVX2, FMA3, 62 GB RAM)
Command: /hpc-home/cheemaj/BUILD/IQTREE/iqtree-2.2.0-Linux/bin/iqtree2 -s prank-48_alignment.phy -m WAG+I+G4 -B 1000
Seed:    585941 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Fri Jan 13 15:22:34 2023
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.
